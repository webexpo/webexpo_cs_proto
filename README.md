# WEBEXPO C# Prototype

This repository contains the code underlying the WEBEXPO C# prototype. The prototpe demonstrates how to build applications on top of the [WEBEXPO C# library](https://github.com/webexpo/webexpo_cs_lib).

The scientific report describing the principles and details of the calculations allowed by the WEBEXPO algorithms is not public yet, but some details can be found [here](https://www.irsst.qc.ca/en/publications-tools/publication/i/101066/n/webexpo).
