# WEBEXPO C# Prototype

This repository contains the code underlying the WEBEXPO C# prototype. The prototype demonstrates how to build applications on top of the [WEBEXPO C# library](https://github.com/webexpo/webexpo_cs_lib).

To run the prototype in Windows:
- Download the code (by clicking the green "Clone or download" button)
- Open the folder containing the code
- Double-click on either Prototype.Webexpo.EN.bat (English version) or Prototype.Webexpo.FR.bat (French version)

The scientific report describing the principles and details of the calculations allowed by the WEBEXPO algorithms can be found [here](https://www.irsst.qc.ca/en/publications-tools/publication/i/101066/n/webexpo).
